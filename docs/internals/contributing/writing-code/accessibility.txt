Accessibility
=============

The Django project is committed to being accessible to everyone in all
possible ways. We work to conform to established accessibility standards, an
also to meet our own targets for supporting specific input devices and
assistive technologies.

.. _accessibility-standards:

Accessibility standards
=======================

We work to conform with the `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines`_ (WCAG),
version 2.2, at the AA level. WCAG is the most established standard for web
accessibility. AA-level guidelines are the most common legal compliance target
worldwide.

We also attempt to follow other best practices, such as:

* WCAG 2.2 AAA-level guidelines.
* The upcoming `WCAG 3.0`_ guidelines.
* `Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines`_ (ATAG) 2.0 â€“ guidelines for
  software and services that are used to produce web content.

To learn more about accessibility without diving straight into standards, we
recommend `The A11Y Project`_, a community-driven effort to make digital
accessibility easier.

Accessibility support targets
=============================

Beyond standards, we want to make sure Django actually works for people using
a wide range of input devices and assistive technologies. This has benefits to
make sure Django works better `for everyone`_. The best way to do this
effectively is to take accessibility considerations into account as part of
designing features. If in doubt, consult with users who rely on assistive
technologies or with accessibility experts.

.. _accessibility-testing-baseline:

Accessibility testing baseline
------------------------------

Design the UI with accessibility in mind, and the testing will only be needed
as a final check. For more complex interfaces, confer with other contributors
to decide on testing targets. Reach out to the `Accessibility team`_ for
support and to coordinate testing.

Always test user interface changes with:

* Keyboard-only navigation
* The `Accessibility Insights`_ browser extension's automated checks feature,
  or an equivalent tool with the `Axe`_ checker.

Where the UI changes could affect those modalities, also test with:

* Touch-only navigation
* 400% browser zoom
* Forced-colors mode (for example Windows Contrast Themes)

.. _assistive-technologies:

Assistive technologies
----------------------

Where the UI changes could affect assistive technologies, here are popular
free options we recommend testing with:

* `NVDA`_ on Windows with Firefox ESR
* `VoiceOver`_ on macOS with Safari
* `Orca`_ on Linux with Firefox ESR
* `Narrator`_ on Windows with Microsoft Edge
* Windows Magnifier and macOS Zoom
* Windows Speech Recognition and macOS Voice Control
* VoiceOver on iOS, or TalkBack on Android
* `Contrast themes`_ on Windows

If you have the expertise or you can work with someone who does, also test
with:

* `JAWS`_ on Windows
* `Dragon`_ on Windows

Known issues and how to help
============================

There are some parts of Django that do not meet our accessibility targets at
the moment. We actively work on fixing issues, both as part of ongoing
maintenance and bigger overhauls. To learn about known issues, and get
involved, see:

* ``#accessibility`` on the `Django Discord server`_.
* `Accessibility issues on the ticket tracker`_.
* Our `django accessibility improvements`_ project board.
* The `Accessibility team`_.
